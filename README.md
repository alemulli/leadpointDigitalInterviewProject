# A Note Before You Begin:
This project is primarily designed to test your ability to learn new technologies and apply them to a project.

If you are having trouble getting started, please refer to the following resources:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

It is common for developers to take different approaches, so there is no single "correct" solution. We recommend focusing on the functionality first, and then styling the application after. If you have any questions, please ask.

Additionally, you are free to use any resources you like, including Google, Stack Overflow, etc.

With that said, it is expected that you will be capable to explain your code and demonstrate your understanding of the technologies used. If you are unable to do so, it will be assumed that you did not write the code yourself.
